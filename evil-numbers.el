;;; Commentary:

;; Increment / Decrement binary, octal, decimal and hex literals

;; works like C-a/C-x in vim, i.e. searches for number up to eol and then
;; increments or decrements and keep zero padding up

;; Known Bugs:
;; See http://github.com/cofi/evil-numbers/issues

;; Install:

;; (require 'evil-numbers)

;; and bind, for example:

;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c +") 'evil-numbers/inc-at-pt)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c -") 'evil-numbers/dec-at-pt)

;; or only in evil's normal and visual state:

;; (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-c +") 'evil-numbers/inc-at-pt)
;; (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd "C-c +") 'evil-numbers/inc-at-pt)
;;
;; (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-c -") 'evil-numbers/dec-at-pt)
;; (define-key evil-visual-state-map (kbd "C-c -") 'evil-numbers/dec-at-pt)

;; Usage:
;; Go and play with your numbers!
